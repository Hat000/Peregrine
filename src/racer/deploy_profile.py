"""Deploy profiles — named, opt-in bundles of the estimator + control settings for a
flight mode. ONE place that assembles the scattered ``NavigatorConfig`` flags + the
uplink ``cmd_rate_scale`` into a single, auditable preset, so a ShadowPC flight is one
named choice rather than a dozen hand-set flags that can drift out of sync.

Two profiles ship today:

- ``vq1_case_a()`` — the LEGACY VQ1 / case-A path: pristine given position/velocity on
  the wire, ODOMETRY attitude, no AHRS, no gate-relative chain. This is EXACTLY the
  default ``NavigatorConfig`` (every flag at its dataclass default) + ``cmd_rate_scale=1.0``
  (identity uplink). Provided so the legacy path is a named, tested baseline — NOT a new
  behaviour. The RL/VQ1 deploy path that does not ask for a profile is byte-identical to
  this (it constructs a bare ``NavigatorConfig``); this function just makes that explicit.

- ``vq2_case_c()`` — the VQ2 SELF-LOCALIZING (case-C) profile (GAP #5 of
  ``docs/reactivation-2026-06-27/case-c-integration-scope.md``). VQ2 §9.3 blocks
  ATTITUDE / LOCAL_POSITION_NED / ODOMETRY / GATE_INFO and the wire carries NO
  magnetometer / NO barometer, so the deployed stack must SELF-LOCALIZE: attitude from an
  IMU AHRS (``use_ahrs``), yaw + z pinned by VISION (``use_vp_yaw`` / ``use_gate_bearing_yaw``
  / ``use_floor_height``), and the gate-relative +L chain (``use_gate_relative`` +
  ``use_rewind_kf`` + ``use_range_channel``) doing the position fix — all with NO given
  position. The body-rate uplink compensates the VQ2 ~2.5x realization gain via
  ``cmd_rate_scale = 1/2.5 = 0.4`` (the live-confirmed control handshake, 2026-06-29).

These are ADDITIVE + OPT-IN. They construct config objects; they do NOT change any default.
Nothing imports this at module load on the VQ1 path, so a stack that never calls a profile
is unaffected. The case-C flags themselves are all gated OFF-by-default in ``NavigatorConfig``
(byte-identical when off); this profile is simply the curated ON bundle.
